    <h1>Privacy Policy — BP Journal</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

    <p>BP Journal respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.
    This privacy policy explains how BP Journal handles your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Storage and Sync</h2>
    <p>Blood pressure readings and related data are stored securely on your device. If you use BP Journal on multiple devices (such as iPhone and iPad) with the same Apple account, your data may be synced across those devices to provide
    a seamless experience.</p>
    <p>BP Journal does not collect, access, or sell your personal health data.</p>
    <p>BP Journal does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.
    All data you enter — including blood pressure readings, pulse rate, and related notes — is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> only.</p>

    <h2>2. Health Data (Apple Health Integration)</h2>
    <p>If you choose to connect BP Journal with <strong>Apple Health</strong>, the app may read or write blood pressure and pulse data only with your explicit consent.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You control all permissions in the Apple Health app.</li>
        <li>You can enable or disable Health access anytime from the app’s Settings tab or in iOS Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices.</li>
        <li>BP Journal does not share this data with any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>BP Journal <strong>does not share, upload, or sell</strong> any data to third parties.
    There are no analytics SDKs, ads, or external tracking services used in the app.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All your readings and settings remain stored locally on your iPhone and protected by Apple’s system security (device passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID).</p>

    <h2>5. Notifications</h2>
    <p>BP Journal may use notifications to remind you to record your blood pressure readings. These reminders are fully optional and can be enabled, modified, or disabled at any time from your device settings.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You may delete the app at any time to remove all locally stored data.</li>
        <li>You may disconnect Apple Health integration at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>BP Journal is intended for use by adults aged 18 and older. It does not target children or knowingly collect data from minors.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or feedback about this policy or the app’s privacy practices, you can contact the developer at:<br>
    <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:nickels-each-86@icloud.com">nickels-each-86@icloud.com</a></p>
